# React Testing Library Demo

## Description
This is a demo application that was built to help demonstrate the fundamentals of React Testing Library in my first Medium article [An Introduction to Testing React Components with React Testing Library](https://medium.com/@sebastian.southern/an-introduction-to-testing-react-components-with-react-testing-library-e7fe7d6d3684).

In it's current state, it is just a form that takes in a username and password and will alert on any incorrect details. In the case of the user passing in a correct username and password, it will display a success message. This will likely go through a few iterations as I write more articles to explain more detailed concepts of using the library.

## Setup and Running Locally
You can install dependencies with the following: `yarn`

You can run the application with: `yarn start`

To run tests, run the following: `yarn test`
